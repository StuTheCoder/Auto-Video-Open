# What is this for a script?

In short: It is a script that looking for new videos of your favorite youtube channel
If a new video was uploaded, the script automaticly open the browser and goes instantly to the new video

# How can I change the settings?

I'm afraid to say that I don't build a user input field in the script in
You have to change the code for yourself

# Why is the code so ugly?

Well, I am a total beginner in Python
That's the reason why it looks so ulgy ( sorry for what :) )
